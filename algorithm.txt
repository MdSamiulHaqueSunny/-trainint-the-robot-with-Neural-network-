Assign all network inputs and output 

Initialize all weights with small random numbers, typically between -1 and 1 

repeat 

    for every pattern in the training set 

        Present the pattern to the network 

//        Propagated the input forward through the network:
            for each layer in the network 
                for every node in the layer 
                    1. Calculate the weight sum of the inputs to the node 
                    2. Add the threshold to the sum 
                    3. Calculate the activation for the node 
                end 
            end 

//        Propagate the errors backward through the network
             for every node in the output layer 
                calculate the error signal 
            end 

            for all hidden layers 
                for every node in the layer 
                    1. Calculate the node's signal error 
                    2. Update each node's weight in the network 
                end 
            end 

//        Calculate Global Error
            Calculate the Error Function
